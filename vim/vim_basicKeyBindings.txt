:w =save changes ie write 

:q =quit

i= insert mode 

a= also insert mode but characters appear  at the right of the cursor 

o= creates a new line the enters the insert mode 

capital a / shift + a= enters insert mode from the end of the line

capital i / shift + i = enters insert mode from the starting of the line 

capital o / shift + o = enters at a new line above the current line 

escape key = gets out of the insert mode 

vi (text file) = in terminal it opens an existing file or creates a new file then opens it

:set number = Line numbering 



//in normal mode 

k = goes up / works as upper arrow key  

j = goes down / works as lower arrow key

h = left key 

l = right key 

~numbers can also be binded with key bindings such as k goes 1 up but 3k goes 3 lines up , h moves by 1 character but 3h moves by 3 character 

:set relativenumber = sets line numbering in such a way that current line is the first  line and other lines are numbered relative to that

/in relative number mode it is easier to navigate using numbers + key bindings(h,j,k,l) as only the relative numbers are given 

:set mouse=a  = activate the mouse features in vim

:set tabstop=4

:set shiftwidth=4

:set colorschemes + tab = set color schemes according to your choice 

:set autoindent 




//in terminal 
 
vi ~/.vimrc =opens the vim configuration file  

you can write aall the settings here so that it sets the vim permanently to those settings , you just dont have to give ':' before everything , the rest is all the same like add " set number , set relativenumber " etc
